# Fan2Field
Building a new version of Fan2Stage focused on live sports.

When the Covid Lockdowns started I immediately realized there was a need for live feedback for all of the people livestreaming from home. 
I built Fan2Stage.  
While it works pretty good, it needs a lot of fixing.  I am not by trade a coder, I am an systems anayst who has turned into an Experience Designer.
The past two years was wasted hiring outside programmers to help improve the app and it got worse insted of better.
So here we are, never quitting.
